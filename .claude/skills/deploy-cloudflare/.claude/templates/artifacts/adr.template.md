# ADR: [Decision Title]

<!--
Architecture Decision Record
Filename: artifacts/adr_NNNN_[topic].md (e.g., adr_0001_database_choice.md)
Owner: Engineering
Handoff to: Engineering (implementation), /swarm-review (security review)
Related Skills: designing-systems, designing-apis, domain-driven-design, cloud-native-patterns, writing-adrs

Format: Based on MADR (Markdown Any Decision Records) - https://adr.github.io/madr/
Best Practices:
- Write ADRs BEFORE committing to implementation
- Keep them short, specific, and comparable across the codebase
- One decision per ADR (not groups of decisions)
- Quantify when possible (SLOs, latency budgets, cost envelopes)
