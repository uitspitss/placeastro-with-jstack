## Problem Statement

[What problem are we solving? Who has this problem? Why does it matter?]

### Evidence

Great PRDs prove problems exist with evidence. Include both types:

**Quantitative Evidence** (numbers that demonstrate impact):
- [Financial metric: e.g., "$X lost per month due to..."]
- [Behavioral data: e.g., "Y% of users abandon at step Z"]
- [Volume indicator: e.g., "N support tickets/week about..."]

**Qualitative Evidence** (insights that explain the human side):
- [User quote: "Direct feedback from user research..."]
- [Support insight: "Common complaint pattern..."]
- [Observation: "During usability testing, we saw..."]

## Next Steps & Handoffs

After PRD approval:

1. [ ] **Architecture Review**: Technical feasibility assessment
   - Trigger: `/swarm-plan` or direct session
   - Output: ADR (`artifacts/adr_[topic].md`)

2. [ ] **UI/UX Designer**: Visual design and wireframes
   - Trigger: `/ui-ux-designer`
   - Output: Design Spec (`artifacts/design_spec_[component].md`)

3. [ ] **Engineering Estimate**: Effort estimation and decomposition
   - Trigger: `/swarm-plan`
   - Output: Implementation Plan (`artifacts/plan_[task].md`)

4. [ ] **Create Beads Issues**: Decompose into trackable work items
   - Command: `bd create "Title" -t feature`

**Related Artifacts**:
- ADR: [Link after architect review]
- Design Spec: [Link after designer review]
- Implementation Plan: [Link after decomposition]
