## Hosting n8n on Google Cloud Run

**URL:** llms-txt#hosting-n8n-on-google-cloud-run

**Contents:**
- Before you begin: get a Google Cloud project
- Easy mode
- Durable mode
- Enable APIs and set env vars
- You may need to login first
- Setup your Postgres database
- Store sensitive data in Secret Manager
- Create a service account for Cloud Run
- Deploy the Cloud Run service
- Troubleshooting

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Google Cloud Run, a serverless container runtime. If you're just getting started with n8n and don't need a production-grade deployment, you can go with the "easy mode" option below for deployment. Otherwise, if you intend to use this n8n deployment at-scale, refer to the "durable mode" instructions further down.

You can also enable access via OAuth to Google Workspace, such as Gmail and Drive, to use these services as n8n workflow tools. Instructions for granting n8n access to these services are at the end of of this documentation.

If you want to deploy to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) instead, you can refer to [these instructions](../google-kubernetes-engine/).

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

- Setting up and configuring servers and containers
- Managing application resources and scaling
- Securing servers and applications
- Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.116.2\
Current `next`: 1.117.0

## Before you begin: get a Google Cloud project

If you have not yet created a Google Cloud project, [do this first](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project) (and ensure you have billing enabled on the project; even if your Cloud Run service runs for free you must have billing activated to deploy). Otherwise, navigate to the project where you want to deploy n8n.

This is the fastest way to deploy n8n on Cloud Run. For this deployment, n8n's data is in-memory so this is only recommended for demo purposes. **Anytime this Cloud Run service scales to zero or is redeployed, the n8n data will be lost.** Refer to the durable mode instructions below if you need a production-grade deployment.

If you have not yet created a Google Cloud project, [do this first](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project) (and ensure you have billing enabled on the project; even if your Cloud Run service will run for free you must have billing enabled to activated to deploy). Otherwise, navigate to the project where you want to deploy n8n.

Open the Cloud Shell Terminal (on the Google Cloud console, either type "G" then "S" or click on the terminal icon on the upper right).

Once your session is open, you may need to run this command first to login (and follow the steps it asks you to complete):

You can also explicitly enable the Cloud Run API (even if you don't do this, it will ask if you want this enabled when you deploy):

(you can specify whichever region you prefer, instead of "us-west1")

Once the deployment finishes, open another tab to navigate to the Service URL. n8n may still be loading and you will see a "n8n is starting up. Please wait" message, but shortly thereafter you should see the n8n login screen.

Optional: If you want to keep this n8n service running for as long as possible to avoid data loss, you can also set manual scale to 1 to prevent it from autoscaling to 0.

This does not prevent data loss completely, such as whenever the Cloud Run service is re-deployed/updated. If you want truly persistant data, you should refer to the instructions below for how to attach a database.

The following instructions are intended for a more durable, production-grade deployment of n8n on Cloud Run. It includes resources such as a database for persistance and secret manager for sensitive data.

## Enable APIs and set env vars

Open the Cloud Shell Terminal (on the Google Cloud console, either type "G" then "S" or click on the terminal icon on the upper right) and run these commands in the terminal session:

You'll also want to set some environment variables for the remainder of these instructions:

## Setup your Postgres database

Run this command to create the Postgres DB instance (it will take a few minutes to complete; also ensure you update the root-password field with your own desired password):

Once complete, you can add the database that n8n will use:

Create the DB user for n8n (change the password value, of course):

You can save the password you set for this n8n-user to a file for the next step of saving the password in Secret Manager. Be sure to delete this file later.

## Store sensitive data in Secret Manager

While not required, it's absolutely recommended to store your sensitive data in Secrets Manager.

Create a secret for the database password (replace "/your/password/file" with the file you created above for the n8n-user password):

Create an encryption key (you can use your own, this example generates a random one):

Create a secret for this encryption key (replace "my-encryption-key" if you are supplying your own):

Now you can delete my-encryption-key and the database password files you created. These values are now securely stored in Secret Manager.

## Create a service account for Cloud Run

You want this Cloud Run service to be restricted to access only the resources it needs. The following commands create the service account and adds the permissions necessary to access secrets and the database:

## Deploy the Cloud Run service

Now you can deploy your n8n service:

Once the deployment finishes, open another tab to navigate to the Service URL. You should see the n8n login screen.

If you see a "Cannot GET /" screen this usually indicates that n8n is still starting up. You can refresh the page and it should eventually load.

## (Optional) Enabling Google Workspace services as n8n tools

If you want to use Google Workspace services (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, etc.) as tools in n8n, it's recommended to setup OAuth to access these services.

First ensure the respective APIs you want are enabled:

Re-deploy n8n on Cloud Run with the necessary OAuth callback URLs as environment variables:

Lastly, you must setup OAuth for these services. Visit `https://console.cloud.google.com/auth` and follow these steps:

1. Click "Get Started" if this button shows (when you have not yet setup OAuth in this Cloud project).
1. For "App Information", enter whichever "App Name" and "User Support Email" you prefer.
1. For "Audience", select "Internal" if you intend to only enable access to your user(s) within this same Google Workspace. Otherwise, you can select "External".
1. Enter "Contact Information".
1. If you selected "External", then click "Audience" and add any test users you need to grant access.
1. Click "Clients" > "Create client", select "Web application" for "Application type", enter your n8n service URL into "Authorized JavaScript origins", and "/rest/oauth2-credential/callback" into "Authorized redirect URIs" where your YOUR-N8N-URL is also the n8n service URL (e.g. `https://n8n-12345678.us-west1.run.app/rest/oauth2-credential/callback`). Make sure you download the created client's JSON file since it contains the client secret which you will not be able to see later in the Console.
1. Click "Data Access" and add the scopes you want n8n to have access for (e.g. to access Google Sheets, you need `https://googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` and `https://googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets`)
1. Now you should be able to use these workspace services. You can test if it works by logging into n8n, add a Tool for the respective service and add its credentials using the information in the OAuth client JSON file from step 6.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
gcloud auth login
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
gcloud run deploy n8n \
    --image=n8nio/n8n \
    --region=us-west1 \
    --allow-unauthenticated \
    --port=5678 \
    --no-cpu-throttling \
    --memory=2Gi
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
gcloud run deploy n8n \
    --image=n8nio/n8n \
    --region=us-west1 \
    --allow-unauthenticated \
    --port=5678 \
    --no-cpu-throttling \
    --memory=2Gi \

## Hosting n8n on Amazon Web Services

**URL:** llms-txt#hosting-n8n-on-amazon-web-services

**Contents:**
- Hosting options
- Prerequisites
- Create a cluster
- Clone configuration repository
- Configure Postgres
  - Configure volume for persistent storage
  - Postgres environment variables
- Configure n8n
  - Create a volume for file storage
  - Pod resources

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.

AWS offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including EC2 (virtual machines), and EKS (containers running with Kubernetes).

This guide uses [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.

The steps in this guide use a mix of the AWS UI and [the eksctl CLI tool for EKS](https://eksctl.io).

While not mentioned in the documentation for eksctl, you also need to [install the AWS CLI tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), and [configure authentication of the tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

- Setting up and configuring servers and containers
- Managing application resources and scaling
- Securing servers and applications
- Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.116.2\
Current `next`: 1.117.0

Use the eksctl tool to create a cluster specifying a name and a region with the following command:

This can take a while to create the cluster.

Once the cluster is created, eksctl automatically sets the kubectl context to the cluster.

## Clone configuration repository

Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting). The following steps tell you what each file does, and what settings you need to change.

Clone the repository with the following command:

And change directory:

## Configure Postgres

For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.

### Configure volume for persistent storage

To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default AWS storage class, [gp3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/general-purpose.html#gp3-ebs-volume-type), is suitable for this purpose. This is defined in the `postgres-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest.

### Postgres environment variables

Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.

The example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own for user details and the database to use.

The `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.

### Create a volume for file storage

While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes helps maintain files uploaded while using n8n and if you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](../../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts, which saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.

The `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) lets you specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` file:

This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:

- **Start**: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
- **Pro (10k executions)**: 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
- **Pro (50k executions)**: 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

### Optional: Environment variables

You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.

Create an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

The two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.

The manifests define the following:

- Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
- Define the container image to use
- Set resource consumption limits
- The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
- Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.

The two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively by default.

## Send to Kubernetes cluster

Send all the manifests to the cluster by running the following command in the `n8n-kubernetes-hosting` directory:

You may see an error message about not finding an "n8n" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to a static address of the instance.

To find the address of the n8n service running on the instance:

1. Open the **Clusters** section of the **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service** page in the AWS console.
1. Select the name of the cluster to open its configuration page.
1. Select the **Resources** tab, then **Service and networking** > **Services**.
1. Select the **n8n** service and copy the **Load balancer URLs** value. Use this value suffixed with the n8n service port (5678) for DNS.

This guide uses HTTP connections for the services it defines, for example in `n8n-deployment.yaml`. However, if you click the **Load balancer URLs** value, EKS takes you to an "HTTPS" URL which results in an error. To solve this, when you open the n8n subdomain, make sure to use HTTP.

If you need to delete the setup, you can remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:

- Learn more about [configuring](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../../scaling/overview/) n8n.
- Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](../../../../try-it-out/).

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
eksctl create cluster --name n8n --region <your-aws-region>
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting.git
```

Example 3 (unknown):

## Configuration

**URL:** llms-txt#configuration

**Contents:**
- Set environment variables by command line
  - npm
  - Docker
- Docker Compose file
- Keeping sensitive data in separate files

You can change n8n's settings using environment variables. For a full list of available configurations see [Environment Variables](../environment-variables/).

## Set environment variables by command line

For npm, set your desired environment variables in terminal. The command depends on your command line.

In Docker you can use the `-e` flag from the command line:

## Docker Compose file

In Docker, you can set your environment variables in the `n8n: environment:` element of your `docker-compose.yaml` file.

## Keeping sensitive data in separate files

You can append `_FILE` to individual environment variables to provide their configuration in a separate file, enabling you to avoid passing sensitive details using environment variables. n8n loads the data from the file with the given name, making it possible to load data from [Docker-Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/) and [Kubernetes-Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

Refer to [Environment variables](../environment-variables/) for details on each variable.

While most environment variables can use the `_FILE` suffix, it's more beneficial for sensitive data such as [credentials](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n) and database configuration. Here are some examples:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
export <variable>=<value>
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
set <variable>=<value>
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
$env:<variable>=<value>
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED="false" \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

---

## Isolate n8n

**URL:** llms-txt#isolate-n8n

By default, a self-hosted n8n instance sends data to n8n's servers. It notifies users about available updates, workflow templates, and diagnostics.

To prevent your n8n instance from connecting to n8n's servers, set these environment variables to false:

Unset n8n's diagnostics configuration:

Refer to [Environment variables reference](../../environment-variables/deployment/) for more information on these variables.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false
N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false
N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED=false
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
EXTERNAL_FRONTEND_HOOKS_URLS=
N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_CONFIG_FRONTEND=
N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_CONFIG_BACKEND=
```

When creating the Droplet, DigitalOcean asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, a basic shared CPU plan is enough.

DigitalOcean lets you choose between SSH key and password-based authentication. SSH keys are considered more secure.

## Log in to your Droplet and create new user

The rest of this guide requires you to log in to the Droplet using a terminal with SSH. Refer to [How to Connect to Droplets with SSH](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/) for more information.

You should create a new user, to avoid working as the root user:

1. Create a new user:

1. Follow the prompts in the CLI to finish creating the user.

1. Grant the new user administrative privileges:

You can now run commands with superuser privileges by using `sudo` before the command.

1. Follow the steps to set up SSH for the new user: [Add Public Key Authentication](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04#step-four-add-public-key-authentication-recommended).

1. Log out of the droplet.

1. Log in using SSH as the new user.

## Clone configuration repository

Docker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy) into the home folder of the logged-in user on your Droplet. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make.

Clone the repository with the following command:

And change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:

## Default folders and files

The host operating system (the DigitalOcean Droplet) copies the two folders you created to Docker containers to make them available to Docker. The two folders are:

- `caddy_config`: Holds the Caddy configuration files.
- `local_files`: A folder for files you upload or add using n8n.

### Create Docker volumes

To persist the Caddy cache between restarts and speed up start times, create [a Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) that Docker reuses between restarts:

Create a Docker volume for the n8n data:

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the Droplet. The exact steps for this depend on your DNS provider, but typically you need to create a new "A" record for the n8n subdomain. DigitalOcean provide [An Introduction to DNS Terminology, Components, and Concepts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-dns-terminology-components-and-concepts).

n8n runs as a web application, so the Droplet needs to allow incoming access to traffic on port 80 for non-secure traffic, and port 443 for secure traffic.

Open the following ports in the Droplet's firewall by running the following two commands:

n8n needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the Docker container. The example `.env` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own.

Open the file with the following command:

The file contains inline comments to help you know what to change.

Refer to [Environment variables](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

## The Docker Compose file

The Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) defines the services the application needs, in this case Caddy and n8n.

- The Caddy service definition defines the ports it uses and the local volumes to copy to the containers.
- The n8n service definition defines the ports it uses, the environment variables n8n needs to run (some defined in the `.env` file), and the volumes it needs to copy to the containers.

The Docker Compose file uses the environment variables set in the `.env` file, so you shouldn't need to change it's content, but to take a look, run the following command:

Caddy needs to know which domains it should serve, and which port to expose to the outside world. Edit the `Caddyfile` file in the `caddy_config` folder.

Change the placeholder domain to yours. If you followed the steps to name the subdomain n8n, your full domain is similar to `n8n.example.com`. The `n8n` in the `reverse_proxy` setting tells Caddy to use the service definition defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

If you were to use `automate.example.com`, your `Caddyfile` may look something like:

## Start Docker Compose

Start n8n and Caddy with the following command:

This may take a few minutes.

In your browser, open the URL formed of the subdomain and domain name defined earlier. Enter the user name and password defined earlier, and you should be able to access n8n.

## Stop n8n and Caddy

You can stop n8n and Caddy with the following command:

If you run n8n using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update n8n:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
adduser <username>
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
usermod -aG sudo <username>
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy.git
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
cd n8n-docker-caddy
```

## Docker Compose

**URL:** llms-txt#docker-compose

n8n:
    environment:
      - EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true
      - EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168
	  	- EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT=50000
```

If you run n8n using the default SQLite database, the disk space of any pruned data isn't automatically freed up but rather reused for future executions data. To free up this space configure the `DB_SQLITE_VACUUM_ON_STARTUP` [environment variable](../../configuration/environment-variables/database/#sqlite) or manually run the [VACUUM](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html) operation.

Binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. This may change in future.

**Contents:**
- User data
- Backups
- Restarting

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

See the [hosting documentation](../../hosting/installation/server-setups/) for detailed setup options.

n8n recommends that you follow the same or similar practices used internally for n8n Cloud: Save user data using [Rook](https://rook.io/) and, if an n8n server goes down, a new instance starts on another machine using the same data.

Due to this, you don't need to use backups except in case of a catastrophic failure, or when a user wants to reactivate their account within your prescribed retention period (two weeks for n8n Cloud).

n8n recommends creating nightly backups by attaching another container, and copying all data to this second container. In this manner, RAM usage is negligible, and so doesn't impact the amount of users you can place on the server.

If your instance is down or restarting, missed executions (for example, Cron or Webhook nodes) during this time aren't recoverable. If it's important for you to maintain 100% uptime, you need to build another proxy in front of it which caches the data.

To grant access to a different user, type the following, substituting `<USER_TO_RUN_DOCKER>` with the appropriate username:
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
You will need to run `exec sg docker newgrp` from any of that user's existing sessions for it to access the new group permissions.

You can verify that your current session recognizes the `docker` group by typing:
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
## 3. DNS setup

To host n8n online or on a network, create a dedicated subdomain pointed at your server.

Add an A record to route the subdomain accordingly:

| Record type | Name                              | Destination                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| A           | `n8n` (or your desired subdomain) | `<your_server_IP_address>` |

## 4. Create an `.env` file

Create a project directory to store your n8n environment configuration and Docker Compose files and navigate inside:
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
Inside the `n8n-compose` directory, create an `.env` file to customize your n8n instance's details. Change it to match your own information:

## Troubleshooting and errors

**URL:** llms-txt#troubleshooting-and-errors

**Contents:**
- Error: Missing packages
- Prevent loading community nodes on n8n cloud

## Error: Missing packages

n8n installs community nodes directly onto the hard disk. The files must be available at startup for n8n to load them. If the packages aren't available at startup, you get an error warning of missing packages.

If running n8n using Docker: depending on your Docker setup, you may lose the packages when you recreate your container or upgrade your n8n version. You must either:

- Persist the contents of the `~/.n8n/nodes` directory. This is the best option. If you follow the [Docker installation](../../../hosting/installation/docker/) guide, the setup steps include persisting this directory.
- Set the `N8N_REINSTALL_MISSING_PACKAGES` environment variable to `true`.

The second option might increase startup time and may cause health checks to fail.

## Prevent loading community nodes on n8n cloud

If your n8n cloud instance crashes and fails to start, you can prevent installed community nodes from loading on instance startup. Visit the [Cloud Admin Panel](../../../manage-cloud/cloud-admin-dashboard/) > **Manage** and toggle **Disable all community nodes** to **`true`**. This toggle is only visible when you allow community node installation.

## Hosting n8n on Azure

**URL:** llms-txt#hosting-n8n-on-azure

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Hosting options
- Open the Azure Kubernetes Service
- Create a cluster
- Set Kubectl context
- Clone configuration repository
- Configure Postgres
  - Configure volume for persistent storage
  - Postgres environment variables
- Configure n8n

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Azure. It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.

You need [The Azure command line tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

- Setting up and configuring servers and containers
- Managing application resources and scaling
- Securing servers and applications
- Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.116.2\
Current `next`: 1.117.0

Azure offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including Azure Container Instances (optimized for running containers), Linux Virtual Machines, and Azure Kubernetes Service (containers running with Kubernetes).

This guide uses the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.

The steps in this guide use a mix of the Azure UI and command line tool, but you can use either to accomplish most tasks.

## Open the Azure Kubernetes Service

From [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) select **Kubernetes services**.

From the Kubernetes services page, select **Create** > **Create a Kubernetes cluster**.

You can select any of the configuration options that suit your needs, then select **Create** when done.

## Set Kubectl context

The remainder of the steps in this guide require you to set the Azure instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and then the **Connect** button. The resulting code snippets shows the steps to paste and run into a terminal to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new cluster.

## Clone configuration repository

Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting). The following steps tell you which file configures what and what you need to change.

Clone the repository with the following command:

And change directory:

## Configure Postgres

For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.

### Configure volume for persistent storage

To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default storage class is suitable for this purpose and is defined in the `postgres-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest.

Specialized storage classes

If you have specialised or higher requirements for storage classes, [read more on the options Azure offers in the documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-storage#storage-classes).

### Postgres environment variables

Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.

The example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database..

The `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.

### Create a volume for file storage

While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for:

- Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node.
- If you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](../../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.

The `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.

[Kubernetes lets you](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` file:

This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:

- **Start**: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
- **Pro (10k executions)**: 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
- **Pro (50k executions)**: 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

### Optional: Environment variables

You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.

Create an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

The two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.

The manifests define the following:

- Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
- Define the container image to use
- Set resource consumption limits with the `resources` object
- The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
- Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.

The two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively.

## Send to Kubernetes cluster

Send all the manifests to the cluster with the following command:

You may see an error message about not finding an "n8n" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the **Services & ingresses** menu item of the cluster you want to use under the **External IP** column. You need to add the n8n port, "5678" to the URL.

Static IP addresses with AKS

[Read this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/static-ip) for more details on how to use a static IP address with AKS.

Remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:

- Learn more about [configuring](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../../scaling/overview/) n8n.

Current `latest`: 1.116.2\
Current `next`: 1.117.0

1. [Log in](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) to the Hetzner Cloud Console.
1. Select the project to host the server, or create a new project by selecting **+ NEW PROJECT**.
1. Select **+ CREATE SERVER** on the project tile you want to add it to.

You can change most of the settings to suit your needs, but as this guide uses Docker to run the application, under the **Image** section, select "Docker CE" from the **APPS** tab.

When creating the server, Hetzner asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, the CPX11 type is enough.

Hetzner lets you choose between SSH and password-based authentication. SSH is more secure. The rest of this guide assumes you are using SSH.

## Log in to your server

The rest of this guide requires you to log in to the server using a terminal with SSH. Refer to [Access with SSH/rsync/BorgBackup](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/storage-box/access/access-ssh-rsync-borg) for more information. You can find the public IP in the listing of the servers in your project.

## Install Docker Compose

The Hetzner Docker app image doesn't have Docker compose installed. Install it with the following commands:

## Clone configuration repository

Docker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy) into the root user folder of the server. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make.

- npm: the `n8n` command is directly available. The documentation uses this in the examples below.

- Docker: the `n8n` command is available within your Docker container:

You can start workflows directly using the CLI.

Execute a saved workflow by its ID:

## Change the active status of a workflow

You can change the active status of a workflow using the CLI.

These commands operate on your n8n database. If you execute them while n8n is running, the changes don't take effect until you restart n8n.

Set the active status of a workflow by its ID to false:

Set the active status of a workflow by its ID to true:

Set the active status to false for all the workflows:

Set the active status to true for all the workflows:

You can export your database entities from n8n using the CLI. This tooling allows you to export all entity types from one database type, such as SQLite, and import them into another database type, such as Postgres.

| Flag                                | Description                                                                                    |

| --includeExecutionHistoryDataTables | Include execution history data tables, these are excluded by default as they can be very large |

## Export workflows and credentials

You can export your workflows and credentials from n8n using the CLI.

| Flag        | Description                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --help      | Help prompt.                                                                                |
| --all       | Exports all workflows/credentials.                                                          |
| --backup    | Sets --all --pretty --separate for backups. You can optionally set --output.                |
| --id        | The ID of the workflow to export.                                                           |
| --output    | Outputs file name or directory if using separate files.                                     |
| --pretty    | Formats the output in an easier to read fashion.                                            |
| --separate  | Exports one file per workflow (useful for versioning). Must set a directory using --output. |
| --decrypted | Exports the credentials in a plain text format.                                             |

Export all your workflows to the standard output (terminal):

Export a workflow by its ID and specify the output file name:

Export all workflows to a specific directory in a single file:

Export all the workflows to a specific directory using the `--backup` flag (details above):

Export all your credentials to the standard output (terminal):

Export credentials by their ID and specify the output file name:

Export all credentials to a specific directory in a single file:

Export all the credentials to a specific directory using the `--backup` flag (details above):

Export all the credentials in plain text format. You can use this to migrate from one installation to another that has a different secret key in the configuration file.

Sensitive information

All sensitive information is visible in the files.

You can import entities from a previous `export:entities` command using this command, it allows importing of entities into a database type that differs from the exported database type. Current supported database types include: SQLite, Postgres.

The database is expected to be empty prior to import, this can be forced with the `--truncateTables` parameter.

| Flag             | Description                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| --help           | Help prompt.                                       |
| --inputDir       | Input directory that holds output files for import |
| --truncateTables | Truncate tables before import                      |

## Import workflows and credentials

You can import your workflows and credentials from n8n using the CLI.

When exporting workflows and credentials, n8n also exports their IDs. If you have workflows and credentials with the same IDs in your existing database, they will be overwritten. To avoid this, delete or change the IDs before importing.

| Flag        | Description                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| --help      | Help prompt.                                                                               |
| --input     | Input file name or directory if you use --separate.                                        |
| --projectId | Import the workflow or credential to the specified project. Can't be used with `--userId`. |
| --separate  | Imports `*.json` files from directory provided by --input.                                 |
| --userId    | Import the workflow or credential to the specified user. Can't be used with `--projectId`. |

n8n limits workflow and credential names to 128 characters, but SQLite doesn't enforce size limits.

This might result in errors like **Data too long for column name** during the import process.

In this case, you can edit the names from the n8n interface and export again, or edit the JSON file directly before importing.

Import workflows from a specific file:

Import all the workflow files as JSON from the specified directory:

Import credentials from a specific file:

Import all the credentials files as JSON from the specified directory:

Clear your existing license from n8n's database and reset n8n to default features:

If your license includes [floating entitlements](../../glossary/#entitlement-n8n), running this command will also attempt to release them back to the pool, making them available for other instances.

Display information about the existing license:

You can reset user management using the n8n CLI. This returns user management to its pre-setup state. It removes all user accounts.

Use this if you forget your password, and don't have SMTP set up to do password resets by email.

### Disable MFA for a user

If a user loses their recovery codes you can disable MFA for a user with this command. The user will then be able to log back in to set up MFA again.

You can reset the LDAP settings using the command below.

## Uninstall community nodes and credentials

You can manage [community nodes](../../integrations/community-nodes/installation/) using the n8n CLI. For now, you can only uninstall community nodes and credentials, which is useful if a community node causes instability.

| Flag         | Description                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --help       | Show CLI help.                                                                                                             |
| --credential | The credential type. Get this value by visiting the node's `<NODE>.credential.ts` file and getting the value of `name`.    |
| --package    | Package name of the community node.                                                                                        |
| --uninstall  | Uninstalls the node.                                                                                                       |
| --userId     | The ID of the user who owns the credential. On self-hosted, query the database. On cloud, query the API with your API key. |

Uninstall a community node by package name:

For example, to uninstall the [Evolution API community node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-evolution-api), type:

Uninstall a community node credential:

For example, to uninstall the [Evolution API community node credential](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-evolution-api), visit the [repository](https://github.com/oriondesign2015/n8n-nodes-evolution-api) and navigate to the [`credentials.ts` file](https://github.com/oriondesign2015/n8n-nodes-evolution-api/blob/main/credentials/EvolutionApi.credentials.ts) to find the `name`:

You can run a [security audit](../securing/security-audit/) on your n8n instance, to detect common security issues.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
docker exec -u node -it <n8n-container-name> <n8n-cli-command>
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
n8n execute --id <ID>
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
n8n update:workflow --id=<ID> --active=false

## Hosting n8n on Google Kubernetes Engine

**URL:** llms-txt#hosting-n8n-on-google-kubernetes-engine

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Create project
- Enable the Kubernetes Engine API
- Create a cluster
- Set Kubectl context
- Clone configuration repository
- Configure Postgres
  - Create a volume for persistent storage
  - Postgres environment variables
- Configure n8n

Google Cloud offers several options suitable for hosting n8n, including Cloud Run (optimized for running containers), Compute Engine (VMs), and Kubernetes Engine (containers running with Kubernetes).

This guide uses the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) as the hosting option. If you want to use Cloud Run, refer to [these instructions](../google-cloud-run/).

Most of the steps in this guide use the Google Cloud UI, but you can also use the [gcloud command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) instead to undertake all the steps.

- The [gcloud command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)
- The [gke-gcloud-auth-plugin](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke) (install the gcloud CLI first)

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

- Setting up and configuring servers and containers
- Managing application resources and scaling
- Securing servers and applications
- Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.116.2\
Current `next`: 1.117.0

GCP encourages you to create projects to logically organize resources and configuration. Create a new project for your n8n deployment from your Google Cloud Console: select the project dropdown menu and then the **NEW PROJECT** button. Then select the newly created project. As you follow the other steps in this guide, make sure you have the correct project selected.

## Enable the Kubernetes Engine API

GKE isn't enabled by default. Search for "Kubernetes" in the top search bar and select "Kubernetes Engine" from the results.

Select **ENABLE** to enable the Kubernetes Engine API for this project.

From the [GKE service page](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list/overview), select **Clusters** > **CREATE**. Make sure you select the "Standard" cluster option, n8n doesn't work with an "Autopilot" cluster. You can leave the cluster configuration on defaults unless there's anything specifically you need to change, such as location.

## Set Kubectl context

The rest of the steps in this guide require you to set the GCP instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and selecting **CONNECT**. The displayed code snippet shows a connection string for the gcloud CLI tool. Paste and run the code snippet in the gcloud CLI to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new gcloud cluster.

## Clone configuration repository

Kubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting) locally. The following steps explain the file configuration and how to add your information.

Clone the repository with the following command:

And change directory:

## Configure Postgres

For larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.

### Create a volume for persistent storage

To maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. Running Postgres on GCP requires a specific Kubernetes Storage Class. You can read [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/deploying-highly-available-postgresql-with-gke) for specifics, but the `storage.yaml` manifest creates it for you. You may want to change the regions to create the storage in under the `allowedTopologies` > `matchedLabelExpressions` > `values` key. By default, they're set to `us-central`.

### Postgres environment variables

Postgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.

The example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database..

The `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.

### Create a volume for file storage

While not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for:

- Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node.
- If you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](../../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.

The `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.

[Kubernetes lets you](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml` files:

This defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:

- **Start**: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
- **Pro (10k executions)**: 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
- **Pro (50k executions)**: 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

### Optional: Environment variables

You can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.

Create an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.

The two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.

The manifests define the following:

- Send the environment variables defined to each application pod
- Define the container image to use
- Set resource consumption limits with the `resources` object
- The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.
- Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.

The two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively.

## Send to Kubernetes cluster

Send all the manifests to the cluster with the following command:

You may see an error message about not finding an "n8n" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:

n8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the **Services & Ingress** menu item of the cluster you want to use under the **Endpoints** column.

[Read this GKE tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/configuring-domain-name-static-ip#configuring_your_domain_name_records) for more details on how reserved IP addresses work with GKE and Kubernetes resources.

Remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:

- Learn more about [configuring](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../../scaling/overview/) n8n.
- Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](../../../../try-it-out/).

## Hosting n8n on Heroku

**URL:** llms-txt#hosting-n8n-on-heroku

**Contents:**
- Use the deployment template to create a Heroku project
  - Configure environment variables
  - Deploy n8n
- Changing the deployment template
  - The Dockerfile
  - Heroku and exposing ports
  - Configuring Heroku
- Next steps

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Heroku. It uses:

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to create and define the application components and how they work together.
- [Heroku's PostgreSQL service](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/heroku-postgres) to host n8n's data storage.
- A **Deploy to Heroku** button offering a one click, with minor configuration, deployment.

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

- Setting up and configuring servers and containers
- Managing application resources and scaling
- Securing servers and applications
- Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.116.2\
Current `next`: 1.117.0

## Use the deployment template to create a Heroku project

The quickest way to get started with deploying n8n to Heroku is using the **Deploy to Heroku** button:

This opens the **Create New App** page on Heroku. Set a name for the project, and choose the region to deploy the project to.

### Configure environment variables

Heroku pre-fills the configuration options defined in the `env` section of the `app.json` file, which also sets default values for the environment variables n8n uses.

You can change any of these values to suit your needs. You must change the following values:

- **N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY**, which n8n uses to [encrypt user account details](../../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) before saving to the database.
- **WEBHOOK_URL** should match the application name you create to ensure that webhooks have the correct URL.

Select **Deploy app**.

After Heroku builds and deploys the app it provides links to **Manage App** or **View** the application.

Refer to the [Heroku documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/networking-dns) to find out how to connect your domain to a Heroku application.

## Changing the deployment template

You can make changes to the deployment template by forking the [repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-heroku) and deploying from you fork.

By default the Dockerfile pulls the latest n8n image, if you want to use a different or fixed version, then update the image tag on the top line of the `Dockerfile`.

### Heroku and exposing ports

Heroku doesn't allow Docker-based applications to define an exposed port with the `EXPOSE` command. Instead, Heroku provides a `PORT` environment variable that it dynamically populates at application runtime. The `entrypoint.sh` file overrides the default Docker image command to instead set the port variable that Heroku provides. You can then access n8n on port 80 in a web browser.

Docker limitations with Heroku

[Read this guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime#unsupported-dockerfile-commands) for more details on the limitations of using Docker with Heroku.

### Configuring Heroku

The `heroku.yml` file defines the application you want to create on Heroku. It consists of two sections:

- `setup` > `addons` defines the Heroku addons to use. In this case, the PostgreSQL database addon.
- The `build` section defines how Heroku builds the application. In this case it uses the Docker buildpack to build a `web` service based on the supplied `Dockerfile`.

- Learn more about [configuring](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../../scaling/overview/) n8n.
- Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](../../../../try-it-out/).

## Deployment environment variables

**URL:** llms-txt#deployment-environment-variables

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

This page lists the deployment configuration options for your self-hosted n8n instance, including setting up access URLs, enabling templates, customizing encryption, and configuring server details.

Proxy variable priorities

The [`proxy-from-env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-from-env) package that n8n uses to handle proxy environment variables (those ending with `_PROXY`) imposes a certain variable precedence. Notably, for proxy variables, lowercase versions (like `http_proxy`) have precedence over uppercase variants (for example `HTTP_PROXY`) when both are present.
